# ✅ MAXIMUM MEMBERS - FIXED

## Problem:
The "Maximum Members" slider was defaulted to 10, which might not be appropriate for all pools. Pool creators need to actively choose the right size for their group.

## Solution:

### 1. Changed Default Value
- **Old:** 10 members (too high for small groups)
- **New:** 5 members (more reasonable starting point)

### 2. Added Helper Text
Added clear guidance:
> "Choose based on your group size. This cannot be changed later."

This reminds pool creators that:
- They should think carefully about the size
- The decision is permanent
- They should choose based on their actual group

## Benefits:

✅ **More Intentional:** Pool creators will actively adjust the slider
✅ **Better Defaults:** 5 is more appropriate for family/friend groups
✅ **Clear Warning:** Users know this can't be changed later
✅ **Flexible:** Still allows 2-50 members range

## Example Use Cases:

- **Family Pool:** 3-5 members
- **Friends Pool:** 5-10 members
- **Office Pool:** 10-20 members
- **Community Pool:** 20-50 members

**The pool creator now has full control and clear guidance!** 🎯
