## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Best Approach**: Parallel execution

1. **You do**: Start legal compliance (company registration, lawyer consultation)
2. **I help with**: Complete quick fixes and backend connections (this week)
3. **Next**: Critical integrations (payment gateway, notifications)

This way, legal processes run in background while we complete technical work.
